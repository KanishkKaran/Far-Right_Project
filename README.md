# Far-Right_Project

This project was my Master's Project at Columbia University. In this project, I was looking at how far-right groups spreading fake news or hate meme campaigns online. I performed Computer-Assisted Reporting while tried to follow up on these profiles on social platforms like Reddit, Discord and Telegram. Other than the usual reporting, I did some digital forensics to look at some of these users who spreading these messages. 

Some important thoughts that helped me in progressing with the research:
> Who are spreading these campaigns?
> Are these camapaigns active in other countries?
> What's their agenda ?
> Main Question: What online tools are they using for their campaigns?
